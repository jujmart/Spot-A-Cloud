Ask about inherit from Base
    each table needed own instance of Base

do tables need to be in the same file(refrencing)
    aparently not using import

    forces a unique constraint, keeps user1 from being able to follow user1

does " from file import * "   the same as seed_genre and undo_genre
    yes not encouraged cause bad
